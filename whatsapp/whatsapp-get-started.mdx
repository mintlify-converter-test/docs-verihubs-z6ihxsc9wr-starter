# WhatsApp Messaging Limits

Messaging limits determine the maximum number of business-initiated conversations each phone number can start in a rolling 24-hour period. These limits do not apply to user-initiated conversations. A business-initiated conversation starts when the first message is delivered to a customer and ends 24 hours later. This limits implemented by the WhatsApp itself.

If you reach your messaging limit, you can start more conversations as soon as one or more active conversations end. Messaging limits do not apply to user-initiated conversations.

You can send message templates to up to 250 unique customers in a rolling 24 hour period, **right after onboarding**, and only need to complete business verification if you wish to scale.

There are four levels of messaging limits that apply to businesses that **have completed Business Verification**:  
Allows your phone number to have 1,000 business-initiated conversations (with 1,000 unique customers) in a rolling 24-hour period.  
Allows your phone number to have 10,000 business-initiated conversations (with 10,000 unique customers) in a rolling 24-hour period.  
Allows your phone number to have 100,000 business-initiated conversations (with 100,000 unique customers) in a rolling 24-hour period.  
Allows your phone number to have unlimited business-initiated conversations in a rolling 24-hour period.

You are automatically upgraded to a higher tier based on the volume and quality of the messages you send. Conversely, you can be downgraded if more of your messages are reported by users.
